Welcome to the Discord Server, {USER}!

-------------

Before you start your Discord journey, go to the bottom left of the webpage or desktop app and click the gear. Fiddle with things in there until you're happy with your settings. It's highly recommended to have a good look at the voice settings if you're planning on using voice chats.

We don't have very specific rules in here, just don't be a prick and use common sense. Admins will remove you if you're uncapable of doing so.

Enjoy your stay!
